Subject: Corruption Complaint Against City Attorney and Associates for Suppressing First Amendment Rights

Dear Los Angeles County District Attorneyâ€™s Office Public Integrity Division,

My name is Enri Marini, and I am writing to formally submit a complaint of corruption against City Attorney Hydee Soto, Arturo Martinez (Head Deputy Supervising Attorney, City of Los Angeles Filing Division), and Jim McDougal (Deputy City Attorney of Los Angeles). I believe these individuals have colluded with the Church of Scientology to suppress the First Amendment rights of its protestors.

This is not an isolated incident but a pattern of behavior by Hydee Soto and her team. They have repeatedly issued frivolous charges against protestors, despite clear video evidence and law enforcement consensus that no laws were violated. I am one such victim, facing misdemeanor vandalism charges for allegedly damaging plastic netting on June 16th, which was obstructing a public sidewalk without a permit. Video footage of the incident, available on my YouTube channel @EthicsAndEngineering, clearly shows my actions were lawful.

Despite this, I have been served with a stay-away order, effectively silencing my right to protest on public property near the Church of Scientology. This tactic is used to delay justice and suppress free speech, with Scientology exploiting the legal system to wear down protestors.

I have reported this ongoing corruption to multiple agencies, including the Office of the Inspector General, the California State Bar Association, and the FBI. This corruption extends beyond these individuals, and I urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation.

The Church of Scientology has a history of abusing the legal system to silence critics, and now, they are manipulating the criminal courts to achieve the same. Recent cases involving protestors, such as William Gude and Scott Hochstetter, have shown a pattern of SLAPP suits and meritless criminal charges, all aimed at suppressing free speech. These charges are often dropped, but not before causing significant harm to the protestors involved.

This misuse of legal authority by the aforementioned attorneys is a grave violation of legal ethics and a threat to the integrity of the justice system. I call on your office to investigate and hold these individuals accountable to restore public trust and protect the rights of citizens.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Enri Marini
